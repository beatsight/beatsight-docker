# Summary of What the Command Does
#     Creates a temporary file.
#     Saves the current environment variables to that file.
#     Sets the shell to export all subsequently defined variables.
#     Sources a file (specified by $_ENV) that may define additional environment variables.
#     Stops the automatic exporting of new variables.
#     Sources the temporary file to restore the previously saved environment variables.
#     Cleans up by deleting the temporary file and unsetting the variable t.

# Purpose
# The overall purpose of this command sequence is to manage and preserve the environment variables within a shell session, allowing for the integration of additional variables from a specified file while ensuring that the original environment is restored afterward. This is useful in scenarios where you want to temporarily modify the environment without permanently affecting it.
